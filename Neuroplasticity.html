      <h2>Learning about Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="date">September 07, 2025</p>
      
      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
       <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brain’s remarkable ability to reshape itself by strengthening, weakening, or creating new neural pathways in response to learning and
        enabling us to acquire new skills, adapt to change, recover from damage, and continuously evolve throughout life.
        </p><br>
        <p>  
        It does this by:        
        </p><br>
<ul>
    <li>Strengthening or weakening connections between neurons.</li>
    <li>Growing new connections or pruning away unused ones.</li>
    <li>In some regions, even making new neurons.</li>
</ul>
      <p>
     Two ways that this supports people are as.
      </p><br>
   <h3>Supports Mental Health</h3><br>
      <p>
      Understanding that therapy, mindfulness, and healthy habits can physically reshape the brain gives hope for overcoming depression, anxiety, or trauma.
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) uses repetition of healthier thought patterns to rewire the brain.

<h3>Boosts Learning and Performance</h3><br>
      <p>
      Understanding that therapy, mindfulness, and healthy habits can physically reshape the brain gives hope for overcoming depression, anxiety, or trauma.

      </p>
      <p>
      Students, athletes and professionals can improve learning by spacing practice using repetition and engaging multiple senses—all methods that harness neuroplasticity.
    </p><br>
  <h3>Ways to increase Neuroplasticity</h3><br>
    <p>
    some ways in which we can increase Neuroplasticity is to do things like Repetition and Practice by repeating things over and over again new neurons will be formed and remembered. 
    We also can increase it by keeping healthy eating well and keeping out social space open to manage stress better and to not get bogged down in stress.

    I found that using this page was really good and very indepth inregards to neuroplasticity

    <h2>Next is Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      We start with a few questions:
    </p><br>
<ul>
    <li>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</li>
    <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
    <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
</ul><br>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and talents can be delveloped through hard work pratice and learning. Its relevant to us because in life we have lots of things 
      that we may want to learn and to learn these things we may need to take a step out of our comfort zone and push our minds and bodys to gain the knowledge that we require
    </p>
    <p>
      During learning about this a few things changed for me as i was not aware of growth mindset or even neuroplasticity. With learning about growth mindset i have found that it has 
      slightly increased my motivation and effort that i put towards coding and i am slowly working on building up confidence in how i learn and what i learn. once i started learning about 
      these subjects i feel my mind has been opened up to a bigger understanding of how i think and how i do things.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Looking into how i am going to intergrate this into my learning journey (i havent noticed but started) was by putting the hours into the work even if it requires more time
      than what is recommended. I started this already by putting in extra time and effort to learn and spend time reading into how JavaScript, HTML or CSS and how they work.
