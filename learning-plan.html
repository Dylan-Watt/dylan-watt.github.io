        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          my long term goal is to become a software / web developer i am aiming
          to have all the study and information required that i need by the age
          of 35
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          A Strength of mine is i will keep doing something until i understand
          and can replicate the same thing over and over again. my main weakness
          is finding information that is enriching and engaging i struggle with
          videos and or information that feels like it drags on i am also a
          visual learner so if i just be told something i wont engage with it as
          much as if i get to try it out myself
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in
          yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <br />

        <p>
          one of the main skills i am learning and want to progress is time
          management and self learning. When i say self learning that is taking
          time to research and process the information
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
          work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
          industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
          building up and starting to get to you
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am going to manage my time load buy setting periods of time through
          the weeks to make sure i have slots so i can stay ontop of work while
          also been able to keep my learning up and ensure the workload is
          enough so i dont get over whelmed and miss and rush important parts of
          work. i manage myself by making sure when i learn or study i am in an
          environment where i am void of distractions so that i can work
          productively i work within rules so that i make sure when working with
          other learners or Facilitators i communicate and let people know what
          i am doing so it enables them to know where i am and what i am doing
          so that there is no jumping over each other and causing issues. When
          things are building up and i get overwhelmed i make lists and take a
          step back to get a fresh view. lists help me work through things i
          need to do one by one.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          i will seek help by by trying first and if i dont have any luck i will
          reach out to one of the tutors to ask for assistance and help working
          to time frames will help me to seek help in a timley way and making
          things as urgent and required asap to.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Facilitation team have been fantasic so far and are very supportive i
          feel that if they are there to support us when we need help there
          isn't much more i could expect from them. i do find have the once a
          fortnight meeting is very very helpful Any scheduling information such
          as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
          example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's
          important to plan these in. Scheduling information for me is very
          simple key dates and times for this course take the number 1 slot of i
          try to work my life around key dates to ensure i am able to meet the
          tutors standards of when and where. if i do have a commitment i try to
          make sure i have work done or get ahead before that time so that i am
          able to enjoy the time i may have off without having to worry about
          been behind.

        <h2>Updated Learning plan things to add since sprint 2</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          My Long term goal still hasnt changed since sprint 2 the only thing
          different is i want to expand my knowledge to be able to have an
          overseas job and work multiple different projects
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          my biggest strength is the time. when i find myself really enjoying
          something i can put my mind to it and spend as much time as i need to
          be able to understand what i am learning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The biggest weakness will be my ability to overcome how i think and
          not to give up if something is much too hard i am also limited by my
          work and dont have much free time before and after work so i need to
          put extra work in to make sure i complete my tasks on time
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reading through the examples 2 of my main non-techinal issues would be
          speaking infront of the group i do feel like i need to spend more time
          talking with the wonderful people we are working with. i also think
          the time management will be a big thing too i want to try and spend as
          much time as i can working on tasks as my work is very limiting
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          i would like to develop my skills with working with others and talking
          in front of others. as i am a person who has always found working by
          myself gets the best results it would be good to work with other like
          minided people.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          my biggest expectation is support Been a new learner it is required to
          have someone who is able to support us when things get tough and i
          find the internet can be good but can also be a letdown as there is so
          many different ways people come to a anwser and some of them may not
          be right or confuse with learnings that are correct
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          the expectations i have of my self is to work hard take in all the
          information i can and to reach out if i need help and to expand my
          communication with anyone and everyone
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Reading the rest of the page for updating our blog for me personally i
          feel listing the items out as i have copied from the website is the
          best way for me to communicate and show my thought process.
