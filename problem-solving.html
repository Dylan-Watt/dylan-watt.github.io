      <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <br />

      <h2>Blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Over the last 6 weeks we have had multiple chances to learn and chances
        to make mistakes
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the problems i had encountered was a simple fix but i spent lots
        of time thinking about why it didnt work. i ended up having to get
        assistance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Issue i ran into was to do with pathing of images and linking them.
        I started off by making sure the image was named correctly and the Jpeg
        Image was in the path for the images after i had checked that these were
        in the correct places i started to check image file names and links to
        make sure that the image was named correctly and there was no difference
        in the file name and the image name.
      </p>

      <p>
        once these had all been checked and made sure things where correct the
        image was still not appearing. stumped on what i needed i next moved to
        looking on google trying to see if i could find anyone who was having my
        issue. after a while of searching i was getting extremly annoyed with
        why the image wasnt linking and i reached out to our tutor who took less
        than a few minutes to see that the path for the file was incorrect and i
        was missing "./" at the start of the img SRC. Such a small issue caused
        a hours worth of work trying to figure out why it wouldnt link.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In the end after all this work and all the googling i found that i was
        over looking such a simple but important function. it taught me to slow
        down and cover every aspect of an issue to break it down and slowly pull
        apart the issue to find the problems that lie within a issue i create
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>One time i fixed a issue with some elegance</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        when i started learning Javascript i run into way too many issues.things
        that seemed simple were not and i made lots and lots of mistakes.one of
        those mistakes was in the java script carnival
      </p>

      <p>
        the issue i had was getting the moles in wack a mole to to be "Wacked" i
        had a function called whackedmole and i had forgot that programmers dont
        start counting at 1. so in the function i started a 1 - 25 instead of
        0-24 and the rest of the code i had wrote was 0-24 so the game was
        having issues linking back to connecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below is the code i wrote for the whacked mole function i had the random
        number here set from 1 - 25
      </p>
      <br />

      <div class="code-box">
        function whackedmole() { whackSound.play() let randomIndex =
        getRandomNumber(0, 24) let randomCell = cellsArray[randomIndex]
        cellsArray.forEach((cell) => (cell.innerHTML = ''))
        randomCell.appendChild(mole) }
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        Once i started working throught the code to figure out what was wrong i
        broke it down into sections. worked on the issue as to why it wasnt
        picking the correct cells for the mole. i checked the other code i wrote
        and saw that the randomnumber i had that was putting the moles was set
        from 0-24 i then checked the whacked mole function and saw i had only
        had it set from 1-25.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        This was the first time that i felt like i was a programmer i gfelt like
        i picked up on the issue by slowing down and assessing the issue at hand
        and found the issue with ease without having to go in depth and do a
        deep dive to see i had for gotten the way to count. I learnt that
        checking over the code making sure things were correct before full panic
        set in was the way to go
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Reflecting on using problem solving techniques</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        when i first saw Pseudocode i had started before hand making very small
        and short lists to try to manage my mind and how things played out on
        paper. Once i started learning about Pseudocode i was able to modifiy my
        lists to beccome Simple but advanced i mixed that with Reflecting at the
        end of doing code. in the JS challenges i mixed the 2 togther so that i
        would go back and reflect on how to write and understand code that i had
        wrote with the assistance of the internet and friends
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        I have found that using more than 1 problem solving technique gives me a
        much better outcome than if i was using just 1 or 2 if i have an issue i
        will break it down and then if i have more issues with the same piece of
        code i have found that the best was is to start using multiple ways to
        solve the issue. my very last resort when i am problem solving is to use
        AI.
      </p>

      <h2>Times i have been reluctant to ask for help</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        I have found i am very reluctant to ask for help with the tutors for the
        fact i am very worried i will be a pain to the tutors so i try to do
        everything i possibly can before asking them. I grew up learning to ask
        for help when you needed it but try first and if you fail have a reason
        as to why you failed and why you cant figure the issue out at hand.
