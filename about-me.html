      <h2>About Me – Dylan Watt</h2>
      <p class="date">August 20, 2025</p>

      <h3>Gamer at Heart</h3>
      <img src="./photos/WOW.jpg" alt="Gaming" class="section-img" />
      <p>
        Gaming is more than just a hobby — it’s where I live half my life.
        You’ll usually find me on Steam (username: RunInFrontOfTraffic — yes,
        really),diving deep into anything tactical, immersive, or just plain
        chaotic. I am a EX pro player now turned to more causal with friends
      </p>

      <h3>Warhammer 40K Junkie</h3>

        class="section-img"
      />
      <p>
        The grimdark future is my happy place. I’ve been into Warhammer 40K for
        years — mostly the lore and videos. I build and paint 40K figures, but
        mostly what gets me hooked is the lore.
      </p>

      <h3>Anime Addict</h3>

        alt="Anime Scene"
        class="section-img"
      />
      <p>
        Anime is a huge part of my life. My all-time favorite is Frieren (Yes
        its the best anime ever), but I’m also a big fan of Demon Slayer and
        Naruto. Honestly, I pretty much watch anything and everything
        anime-related. Whether it’s epic battles, deep stories, or just the cool
        art style, I’m here for it all. Ask me about my top 5 favorites and get
        ready for a long, passionate rant — plus some recommendations you didn’t
        even know you needed.

      <h3>Airsoft Enthusiast</h3>
      <img src="./photos/airsoft.jpg" alt="Airsoft Gear" class="section-img" />
      <p>
        Outside of gaming, I’m really into airsoft. It’s a perfect mix of
        strategy, physical activity, and teamwork. I enjoy planning tactics with
        my squad, moving stealthily, and executing precise shots. It’s
        challenging both mentally and physically, and I like how it pushes me to
        stay sharp and fit (This is a lie).
      </p>

      <h3>Car Guy</h3>
      <img src="./photos/Cars.jpg" alt="Car on the Road" class="section-img" />
      <p>
        Cars are another obsession. I love driving — not just commuting, but
        really driving. Manual transmissions, tight corners, open roads. Whether
        it's tuning up something old or just appreciating a sleek engine, I'm
        all about it. You’ll probably catch me talking about cars I can’t afford
        and mods I shouldn’t try.

        If you’re still reading, congrats you now know more about me than some
        of my friends do.
