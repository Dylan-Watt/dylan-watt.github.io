        <h2>JavaScript and Its Relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          In this blog post i am going to talk about the relationship that HMTL
          and CSS have with JavaScript
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          I start with analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to
          HTML and CSS.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>Think of building a car:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML</strong> is the body and structure -frame, doors,
            windows, and seats. It gives the car its shape and layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS</strong> is the paint job and styling — the colors, the
            design of the interior. It makes the car look appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the engine — it makes the car move,
            respond to input, and function interactively. Without it, the car
            just sits there.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Together, they create a fully working and visually appealing website —
          just like a finished car that looks great and drives well.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life
        </h4>
        <br />

        <p>
          We are going to cross a street how that looks relates to control flow
          and loops
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>we start by breaking this down into steps</p>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>Look both left and right</li>
          <li>If clear then we start to cross</li>
          <li>
            if you are unable you wait for the cars or obstruction to move
          </li>
          <li>
            while you wait you keep checking to make sure its safe to cross
          </li>
          <li>Once it clear cross the road</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
          the control flow in this is checking to make sure its clear and no
          cars are comming then you can cross
        </p>
        <p>
          The Loop is constantly looking left and right untill condition of
          crossing has been met
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          The DOM known as Document Object Model is a programming interface that
          javascript uses access and manage a documents structure. The DOM looks
          like a tree structure if you think of a family tree that is how the
          strucure is made up
        </p>

        <h4>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Accessing data from an array uses numbers 0 - X (Programmers start
          counting from 0 not 1)
        </p>

        <div class="code-box">
          const carParts = ["engine", "wheels", "doors"];
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>This is how you would remove the engine from this array</p>

        <div class="code-box">console.log(carParts[0])</div>
        <br />

        <p>
          Accessing data from a Object is slightly different as it uses Keys
          instead of numbers
        </p>
        <div class="code-box">
          const car = { make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", color: "blue" };
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>to pull the information form this Object you would use to below</p>
        <div class="code-box">console.log(car.make);</div>
        <br />

        <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Functions are a important part of javascript they are a block of code
          that helps preform a specific task
        </p>

        <div class="code-box">
          function greet() { console.log("Hello, world!"); } greet();
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
          what we have here is a function that is saying when greet is used it
          should return hello, world!
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          these are helpful because if you need to be able figure out something
          like adding money or Counting a list of cars the function can enable
          you to do it all at once instead off writing out the calculations over
          and over again
