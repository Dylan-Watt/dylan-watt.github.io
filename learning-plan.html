      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h4>
      <br>
<p>my long term goal is to become a software / web developer i am aiming to have all the study and information required that i need by the age of 35</p><br>
<h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4><br>
<p>A Strength of mine is i will keep doing something until i understand and can replicate the same thing over and over again. my main weakness is finding information that is enriching and engaging i struggle with videos and or information that feels like it drags on i am also a visual learner so if i just be told something i wont engage with it as much as if i get to try it out myself </p><br>

<h4>skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4><br>

<p>one of the main skills i am learning and want to progress is time management and self learning. When i say self learning that is taking time to research and process the information</p><br>

<h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4><br>
<p>I am going to manage my time load buy setting periods of time through the weeks to make sure i have slots so i can stay ontop of work while also been able to keep my learning up and ensure the workload is enough so i dont get over whelmed and miss and rush important parts of work. i manage myself by making sure when i learn or study i am in an environment where i am void of distractions so that i can work productively i work within rules so that i make sure when working with other learners or Facilitators i communicate and let people know what i am doing so it enables them to know where i am and what i am doing so that there is no jumping over each other and causing issues. When things are building up and i get overwhelmed i make lists and take a step back to get a fresh view. lists help me work through things i need to do one by one.</p><br>

<h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4><br>
<p>i will seek help by by trying first and if i dont have any luck i will reach out to one of the tutors to ask for assistance and help working to time frames will help me to seek help in a timley way and making things as urgent and required asap to.</p><br>

<h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4><br>
<p> Facilitation team have been fantasic so far and are very supportive i feel that if they are there to support us when we need help there isn't much more i could expect from them. i do find have the once a fortnight meeting is very very helpful
Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
Scheduling information for me is very simple key dates and times for this course take the number 1 slot of i try to work my life around key dates to ensure i am able to meet the tutors standards of when and where. if i do have a commitment i try to make sure i have work done or get ahead before that time so that i am able to enjoy the time i may have off without having to worry about been behind.</p><br>
