  <h3>ðŸ“­ Contact Me</h3>
<p>If you were hoping to get in touch â€” thatâ€™s adorable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a strictly one-way communication channel. There's no form, no email, no social DMs, and definitely no carrier pigeons. </p>
<p>Just sit back, enjoy the content, and pretend we had a meaningful interaction. Itâ€™s better for both of us.</p>
