    <li>Good time management</li>
    <li>Good problem solving skill</li>
</ul>
<p>Over my life i have found been a good communicator is important and helps in every aspect of life this is going to help with studying when we need to work in groups as i am able to communicate and explain what i am doing.</p>
<p>i have good time management i am good at setting time frames of when things need to be done this will help on the course when we have deadlines or times for things to be handed in.</p>

<h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4><br>
<p>Currently the biggest limitations is my job as it takes alot of time out of my day. this can effect my learning by been too tired and exhausted to want to study.</p><br>
<h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4><br>
<p>My current job has me working with 4 other people, when there is tension or issues in the work place i have found the best thing to do is to write out what the issues are and dicuss the issues with the team or single person. this is a very effective way as it put your words onto paper so you can have someone else read about the issues you are having</p>
