<h1>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>
Starting out in web development can feel like being handed a bunch of mysterious tools with no instructions. HTML, CSS, JavaScript they might as well be spells from a wizard’s book. But once I started to see how they all fit together, things began to make sense
</p>

JavaScript HTML & CSS are like a restaurant

Imagine a restaurant:

<p>HTML is the structure of the restaurant — the walls, tables, chairs, menu boards. It’s what you can see and touch.</p>

<p>CSS is the interior design and style — the colors on the walls, the lighting, the plating of the food. It makes everything look appealing.</p>

<p>JavaScript is the staff and kitchen — the waiters, chefs, and behind-the-scenes action that makes the restaurant actually function. It handles interactions</p>

<h3>Control Flow & Loops Is Like Taking Orders</h3>

<p>Control flow is the order in which actions happen. In a restaurant, the process for taking an order goes something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take their order</li>
<li>Send the order to the kitchen</li>
<li>Serve the food</li>
<li>Give the bill</li>
<li>Thank the customer</li>
</ul>

<p>Thats control flow. One step after another.</p>

<p>Now lets say 5 tables need to be served. Instead of repeating the same steps for every table manually, we use a loop:</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>Your menu is like an array it is a list of items you offer these differ from Objects where objects are unordered collections of data</p>

<p>this is an Array</p>
<img src="Arrays.png" alt="arrays"
width="500"
height="75" />

<p>this is an object</p>

<img src="Object.png" alt="object"
width="600"
height="200" />
