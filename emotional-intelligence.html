      <h2>My Understanding of Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h2>

      <p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ), to me, is about understanding ourselves and others on a deeper level. When I first started learning about it, three key components stood out:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Mindfullness</li>
<li>how one manages emotions</li>
<li>Mental Habits</li>
</ul>

<p>Mindfulness helps us become more aware of our thoughts, feelings, and reactions. It teaches us to be less reactive, especially in challenging situations, by noticing our emotional state instead of being controlled by it.</p><br>

<p>Managing emotions is essential in EQ. For example, when we get angry or frustrated, we often lose sight of the bigger picture. Emotional intelligence helps us recognise these feelings early and respond more thoughtfully.</p><br>
<p>Mental habits are about training our minds to respond more constructively. This includes noticing both our strengths and weaknesses and creating healthy thought patterns that reduce negative self-talk and ego-driven reactions.</p><br>

I also learned that emotional intelligence can be cultivated, much like physical fitness. Our brains are not fixed, we can train and improve them through consistent practice. Some key ways to build EQ include:</p><br>

<ul>
<li>Meditation – something I already practice, which helps clear the mind and improve focus</li>
<li>Conscious listening – deeply listening to others without interrupting or judging</li>
<li>Journaling – a tool for self-discovery and emotional release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall Emotional Intelligence is a skillset we can grow with intention and practice and it plays a powerful role in both personal growth and professional success.</p>
