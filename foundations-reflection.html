      <h1>Reflecting on human skills</h1>

      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        i have found that as i started off i was very quick to try and get
        everything done. i found that i needed to slow down and take my time to
        read and take everything in.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        the second thing i learnt about myself was how i thought and more about
        how my brain was working when i was learning. i left that many times i
        struggled to understand things going back and taking a break and
        thinking things over i was able to come back and learn things much
        better.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Third Point was getting fustrated and just giving up i did find that
        when something got really hard i just didnt bother to try and would
        leave it untill the very last thing to do. i have been able to overcome
        myself by breaking it down and using techniques to get throught a
        problem
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>Empathy - is about bringing you closer to other people as a team.</p>
      <br />

      <p>
        self awareness - looking at yourself in a mirror and changing yourself
        to become better and understand how you work.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Values - are guiding me to what i strive for and want to work towards
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        i am suprised that this was even a thing in a programming course i was
        expecting to spend most of my time learning HTML and CSS and JS then to
        be thinking about my self
      </p>
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I cant sum up the most challenging aspects as its a reflection on me but
        i think the hardest thing for me was taking the time to look back at
        myself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Personally yes. i feel that if the human skills was cut down and
        shortened i would have found that i was able to pick up on other aspects
        of the technical side better. the time that i spent doing human skills
        was longer than the time i spent doing code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I wont say its a waste of time i do think it is good to reflect on
        yourself and your learning skills but i do think that it should be
        shorter. i was spending about 2.5 hours a day learning and 3-5 hours on
        weekends trying to learn and keep up some of the reading for human
        skills lost my attention and i found myself focusing on looking at JS
        code or reading a bit here and there.
