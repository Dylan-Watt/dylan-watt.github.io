    <h2>Understanding Margin, Border & Padding</h2>
    <p class="date">August 26, 2025</p><br>

    <p>In this page, I’m going to explain the difference between <strong>margin</strong>, <strong>border</strong>, and <strong>padding</strong>. These are fundamental concepts in web design that define how elements are spaced and displayed on a webpage.</p><br>

    <h3>Content</h3><br>
    <p>We start with the content — this is the central part of any element. It's where all your base content (like text or images) goes. Think of it as the core of your box.</p><br>

    <h3>Border</h3><br>
    <p>The border is the line that surrounds both the padding and the content. It defines the outer edge of the element, acting as a visible box around everything inside.</p><br>

    <h3>Margin</h3><br>
    <p>Margin is the transparent space outside the border. It’s used to create distance between elements, preventing them from overlapping or touching. Margins help maintain clean separation on your page layout.</p><br>

    <h3>Padding</h3><br>
    <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border. It pushes the content inward, creating room inside the element itself. Padding gives breathing space around the content and is often used to make things more readable.</p><br>

    <h3>Visual Example</h3><br>
    <p>This is an image of a general layout showing how margin, border, and padding are structured:</p><br>
